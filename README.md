# LetsTrace
C# OpenTracing

- Built in support for Zipkin and Jaeger
- Implements C# [OpenTracing API](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-csharp) v. 0.10
- Supports netstandard 2.0

# Under Construction
This library is still under construction and needs to be peer reviewed as well as have features added. It might also be a good idea to break different tracing system support out into different packages.

We still have a number of issues to solve such as the tight coupling to Thrift and Jaeger.Thrift.
